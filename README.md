This is a web app that integrates with electronic targets to quickly give unofficial scores to match participants and spectators in real-time.

From PS file:
	Date/Time in top left - real-time updating
	Relay and Distance in top center - Updates between relays, manual update necessary? Train someone in pit to make updates
	Weather in top right - automatically updates from weather station or feed from PWM (calculate DA)
		Click to open window display time of last update
	Scarborough Fish & Game in bottom left - link to club website, or rifle page? Maybe competitor/spectator info
	NRA Mid-Range in bottom center - link to event bulletin (HTML display of same info as on bulletin)
	All Scores Unofficial in bottom right - link to page explaining that this page is purely for convenience of spectators and competitors, and that no scores are official until published by match organizer.
